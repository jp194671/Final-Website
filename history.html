        <div class="long-paragraph">"Programming dates all the way back to 60 A.D.,
          to the time of Mr. Heron of Alexandria. This fella was a
          mathematician and engineer who was known for his amazing inventions
          and machines. There was one machine in particular that perhaps
          sparked the evolution of computer programming – this specific
          machine had puppets on it, and underneath the machine were a series
          of strings that you could pull, to make the puppets do certain
          things. By simply re-wiring the machine or re-programming the
          machine, you could manipulate the puppets to do different things.
          So, that’s one of the first recorded examples we know of where you
          could program or change the way something is operated without having
           to take it all apart and rebuild it." - Coder Blog</div>

        <div class="long-paragraph">"Coding and computer programming are always changing and
          evolving. As coder nerds, it’s exciting to think about how we can
          program computers to do complex things, and to look back into history
          and see that this has been happening for quite a while. Learn how
          programmers throughout time have imagined and invented new possibilities
           with programming and coding, and how they’ve used their
           (mostly mathematics) skills to make their ideas become a reality –
           something we deal with on a daily basis, thanks to them." - Coder Blog</div>
